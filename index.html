					<h2> Dashingly Handsome & Almost Smart Enough to Code</h2>
						<p>In addition to a sense of humor, I bring a wealth of real world experience to General Assembly's upcoming WDI cohort. Extensive computer work has been perpetual and pervasive throughout my career. Central experiences in the field of healthcare administration include leadership, team building, marketing, revenue enhancement; heavy operational optomization of complicated business processes, while remaining compliant with industry regulatory standards.</p>
						<p>I have a blazing desire to get started in the tech game. Developing my technical skill set with General Assembly will enable me to do so, and win. After course completion I will use my skills, discipline, maturity, and solid work ethic to grow within the industry. In addition to success working in the field of tech, I will use my soon to be acquired skills to establish personal businesses, and do some charity work.
						</p>
						<p>For fun I enjoy playing basketball, being inquisitive, learning new things, and spending time with my family. Playing with my dog Lola is one of my favorite things to do. My wife and I love dogs so much we started our own dog walking company <a href="https://www.harrisonwalkers.com/"target="_blank"/a> Harrison Walkers.<p>
